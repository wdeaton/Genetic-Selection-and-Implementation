  I would like to do my white paper on cattle genetics specifically on the beef side of things. I want to talk about what genetics are and how they are made. Then move on to ways to improve genetics in a beef herd, specifically through artificial insemination. Following that, I would like to talk about expected progeny differences which are a result of genetic change in your herd. Lastly, I want to discuss why genetic change is important in beef herds, and why it is important.
